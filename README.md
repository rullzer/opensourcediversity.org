## 🐛 Issues or suggestions

If you found an issue on the page or only have a quick suggestion (for example a project to add), please open a new issue in [our issue list](https://github.com/opensourcediversity/opensourcediversity.org/issues). Thank you! 👍


## 👩‍💻 Contribute code or design

Contributing to this page is very easy!

1. **💻 Clone this repository** using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) (you can also use the command line)
2. **🌐 Simply open the `index.html`** in [your browser](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) (no web server required since it’s all client-side :)
3. **✏️ Make some changes** using your [text editor](https://atom.io) and test them in the browser
4. 🚀 Use GitHub Desktop to create a branch with your changes, push, and open a pull request

And that’s it! 🎉 Contributing to other open source projects is very similar, so you know the steps already!

As framework we use [🅱️ Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) which you might already be familiar with. It’s very popular, so even if you don’t know it yet, learning about it will help you with lots of other projects too! 😊


## 📐 Project logos

- A good source for logos is their website or Twitter picture. SVG is preferred as the file size is usually smaller and it scales.
- The logos should have a maximum size of 300*300px.
- PNG and JPG logos are compressed with [Trimage](https://trimage.org) which is lossless. (We can also try [Image Shrinker](https://image-shrinker.com) but apparently this is lossy, so we shouldn’t use it for any source assets.)
- SVG images can be compressed using the also lossless scour using the command line: `scour -i filename.svg -o filename-compressed.svg --create-groups --enable-id-stripping --enable-comment-stripping --shorten-ids --remove-metadata --strip-xml-prolog --no-line-breaks;`
